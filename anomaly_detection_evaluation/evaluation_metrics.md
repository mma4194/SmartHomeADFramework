# Evaluation Metrics

## Metrics for Anomaly Detection (AD) Techniques
To comprehensively evaluate anomaly detection techniques, a variety of metrics should be considered. These metrics provide insights into both the effectiveness and efficiency of the technique.

### 1. Performance Metrics
While accuracy is a common metric for evaluating anomaly detection, it does not provide a complete picture. Other metrics should be included to ensure a holistic evaluation:
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among detected anomalies.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true anomalies detected.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: The rate of incorrectly flagged normal behavior.
- **Area Under Curve (AUC)**: Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and FPR.

### 2. Computational Metrics
To evaluate the efficiency of anomaly detection techniques, consider the following computational metrics:
- **CPU Usage**: Percentage of CPU utilized during the operation of the AD technique.
- **Memory Usage**: Percentage of memory consumed during anomaly detection.
- **Runtime**: Time taken to detect anomalies, measured from the input of data to the output of detection results.
- **Energy Consumption**: Total energy used by the system during anomaly detection (optional but valuable in energy-constrained environments).

## Example Evaluation Tools

The following tools are recommended for collecting, storing, and visualizing evaluation metrics:

1. **[Telegraf](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf)**:
   - A plugin-driven agent for collecting and reporting system metrics, including CPU and memory usage.

2. **[InfluxDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb)**:
   - A time-series database designed for storing high-volume metrics data.

3. **[Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana)**:
   - A powerful visualization tool for creating dashboards and visualizing metrics stored in InfluxDB.

---

## Example Workflow
1. **Set Up Telegraf**:
   - Install Telegraf on your system and configure it to collect CPU, memory, and runtime metrics.
2. **Store Metrics in InfluxDB**:
   - Use Telegrafâ€™s output plugin to send the collected data to an InfluxDB instance.
3. **Visualize Metrics in Grafana**:
   - Connect Grafana to InfluxDB and create dashboards to monitor and analyze metrics in real-time.
